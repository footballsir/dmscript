# dmscript
One way to quickly switch DM/LM in figma frames.

1. We have a database to store all tokens for DM & LM. And a matching Figma style library for all token styles.
2. Use script to get all tokens from the database, then match tokens by name with elements' fill stlye or stroke style of the selected Figma frame.
3. Swap the current style with DM/LM stlye in style library.
